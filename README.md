# EmergencyApplication
Provide emergency services coded in java Android studio.

I have designed this application to solve the governments service delivery to 
the community and towing services. This application provides you with a request 
for an ambulance, tow truck and tire rescue which will give you peace of mind when
traveling to different locations and aureity that where ever you are help is just a click away. 

In the case that you are not able to open the application a feature will be added 
so that when you press the physical buttons on your device (volume +, -  or power button ) 
a panic/emergency alert will be sent to the system where your current location will 
be traced and an ambulance will be sent to that location.
